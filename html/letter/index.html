        <h2>Re: Elieen Dover university application</h2>

        Dear Elisen,
        <p>
            Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year.I will answer your questions one by one, in the following.
        </p>
       
        <h3>Staring Dates</h3>

        <p>We are happy to accommodate your staying with us at any time,however it would suit us better if you could start at the beggining of a semester; the start dated for each one are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester : 9 September 2016 </li>
            <li>Second semester : 15th January 2017 </li>
            <li>Third semester : 2 May 2017 </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please let us know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
        <p>You can find more information <a href="#" title ="University Dates"> important university dates </a> on our website.</p>
        
        <h3>Subjects of Study </h3>
        <p>
            At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subject fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have in our team. Saying that, of the ideas you were submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
        </p>
        <ul type ="1">
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.) </li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures excedding 30<code>&#176;</code>C (86&deg;F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
            <li><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>  and  <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"> CSS </abbr> constructs for representing muscial scores.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            So please can you provide more information on each of those subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        </p>

        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
        <p>Yes , you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
            <br>
            <dd>
                A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, 
                ontrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. <q>Lorem Ipsum comes</q>  from sections
            </dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Icelandic browian shuffle</dt>
            <br>
            <dd>
